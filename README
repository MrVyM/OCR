Use the make all command to compile and generate the main.out executable.

./main.out -> Start the XOR network.
./main.out <filepath> [rotationAngle] -> Start the image treatment of the picture located at "filepath". If the rotationAngle isn't specified, we use an angle of 0.

In case, the treatment will do : 
 - resize (resize.bmp)
 - grayscale (grayscale.bmp)
 - binarization/threesholding (threesolding.bmp)
 - rotation (rotation.bmp)
